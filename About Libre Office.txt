While Calc saves spreadsheets in its native Open Document Format (.ods), it can also open and save files in Microsoft Excel format for sending to people still locked into Microsoft products. If you only need to make your data readable, but on a wide range of devices and platforms, you can easily export to Portable Document Format (.pdf). Calc can read .xlsx files created with Microsoft Office for Windows and macOS.
